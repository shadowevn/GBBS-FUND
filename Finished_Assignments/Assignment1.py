# Assignment 1: Variables

# 1. Write a program that creates three variables: name, age, and height (you can use made up numbers). Then print them out.
# 2. Imagine you have a friend who is a bit older than you, and you want to print out the age difference between you and your friend.
# 3. You got married and changed your last name. Update the name variable to your new last name.
# 4. You had a birthday! Update your age variable.

# friend_name = "John"
# friend_age = 30

# name = "" #string

# age = "" #integer

# heigh = "" #float

# print(name)
# print(age)
# print(heigh)

# friend_age = 30
# my_age = 25

# print("Your age difference is", friend_age - my_age, "years")

first_name = "John"
current_last_name = input("what is your current last name?")
new_last_name = input("What is your new last name?")

print( "Your new name is:", first_name +" "+ new_last_name)
